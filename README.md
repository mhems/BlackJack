# BlackJack
Blackjack software suite for text-based blackjack play offering a variety of features
* Intuitive play supporting multiple players
* Highly configurable gameplay parameters to facilitate experimentation with strategies
* Editable basic strategy policies to allow heads-up strategy training
* Various counting methods that can be integrated into play or betting
* Verbose logging features to track player progress and configuration effects

Initial features
* Test-driven development of Blackjack model
* Pluggable human play supporting human input, basic strategy, and counting
* Simulation to test probabilities against empirical results
* Various shuffling algorithms
* Configurable options such as payout ratios, S17, surrender, DAS, ...

Future Features
* extend application to include a GUI
* implement Markov learning deterministic process for online learning of basic strategy
  - manipulate configurations to learn optimal strategies under various scenarios

This is a Python-based exercise in software development to gain experience in TDD and practice writing extensible code in a flexible language.
